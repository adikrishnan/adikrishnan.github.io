      <description>They woke up to the sounds of terror They checked in with their neighbours War had been declared &amp;ldquo;Where do we go?&amp;rdquo;, they wondered in despair
They packed some clothes and left Leaving behind articles close to their chest Lives upturned, buildings burned &amp;ldquo;When is it safe to return?&amp;rdquo;
Sirens sounding loud &amp;ldquo;What place do we call home now? Camps or hotels? What&amp;rsquo;s safe, who can tell?&amp;rdquo;
Soldiers passing by &amp;ldquo;Should we be proud?</description>
